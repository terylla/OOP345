Milestone 3

This was really really really hard...but thank you for being very kind and patient with us. I think having the students to self-teach most of the subject made it extremely difficult and frustrating because most of the time, we could not even get any answer from hours of researching. 

Either way, this class taught me to time-manage pretty well apart from C++. Thank you!
