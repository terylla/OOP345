WORKSHOP 7 REFLECTION

1) I used std::for_each quite often because it's really convenient to apply the lambda to iterate all of the elements in Song to achieve what I need. Such as in cleanAlbum(), I iterated over all albums within Song, then check which album is "[None]" with a simple if condition to change it to the desired output. 
 std::accumulate was also used in display to accumlate the values within Song to the lambda then add to song length.
std::find_if in inCollection() for it is a bool function. It searches through every elemenet within the range specified until it finds the artist, then return true
std::count_if to return the number of elements within the range when the parameter matches the collection.
std::copy_if to copy the range of elements specified to the collection if the parameter matches. 
I also used std::sort simply to sort the elements I am iterating over within Song.

2) I find STL algorithms REALLY complicated at first, but after getting used to it, I find it less confusing than for loop. I have a harder time understanding for loops than algorithm. I understand algorithm more as: here is the range you must iterate over, once you iterate over them then deal with them depending on what the STL function is. 

The hardest part of this workshop is as always, trying to figure out what to do with minimal instruction. I got help from other classmates. Trying to understand how STL functions work took a bit of work too.

QUIZ 5 RELECTION

INCORRECT: 
Purpose of <string_view> 
CORRECT ANSWER:
It allows us to manipulate the view of the string. It is a "string reference" and help programmer avoid copying data that is belonged to someone else.

QUIZ 6 REFLECTION
INCORRECT:
1) For each case (a and b), name a Standard Template Library (STL) container that is optimized for adding and removing elements
a) at the front and the back of a sequence: _____________________ 
b) at random locations within a sequence: _____________________
CORRECT ANSWER:
a) deque/list
b) list

INCORRECT:
Q2) The algorithm category of the STL consists of three distinct libraries. Name the three libraries? 
CORRECT ANSWER:
a) numeric
b) functional
c) algorithm

INCORRECT
3) Explain the effect of std::ios::binary on a file object.
CORRECT ANSWER:
It allows the stream to access the file as a binary. This allows stream to transfer data to and from memory without modification. Ot prevents information loss.
